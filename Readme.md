# Link Status Checker 
This is a small app that regulary checks the status of links and notifies you if any of them go down.


## TODO
* change notifications to use more native feeling notifications
* setup reliable buildprocess
* enable passing config from cli (or gui?)


This app uses Icons made by [Metrize](https://www.flaticon.com/packs/metrize) from [flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com)
